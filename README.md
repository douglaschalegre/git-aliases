# git-aliases
The "git-aliases" repository is a collection of helpful Git aliases that enhance productivity and streamline common Git operations. These aliases are designed to simplify and shorten frequently used Git commands, making Git workflows more efficient.

Decided to create this repo because I always use some custom aliases and always forget how to do them, from time to time I will update this repo with aliases i find useful 😁 Feel free to contribute!
